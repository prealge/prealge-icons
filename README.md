# Prealge Icons

Prealge icons is an experimental icon library. It is still in progress. New icons will be added to the list of icon classes below.

You can see more icons like this at [cssicon.space](cssicon.space)

To add an icon, you simply need a `<div>` with one of the follow classes. If it says 'i required' on the list below, that just means that you need an `<i></i>` tag within the `<div>`. You can see examples below the list.

 - `smiley-icon`
 - `pencil-icon` (i required)


Here is an example of the class `smiley-icon`. It does not require an `<i>` tag.

`<div class='smiley-icon'></div>`

Here is an example of the class `pencil-icon`, which does require an `<i>` tag.

`<div class='pencil-icon'><i></i></div>`
